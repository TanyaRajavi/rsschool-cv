### Code example:
**Task:** Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in. Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0 (for languages that do have them).
Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.

```
function solution(number){
  let sum = 0;
  
  if (number < 0) {
    return sum;
  }
  
  for (let i = 1; i < number; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
      sum += i;
    }
  }
   return sum;
}
```
